# FTC Team 9110 2023 Robot Code

Created for use during Olathe Northwest's in-house competition of the 2023-2024 FIRST Tech Challenge game CENTERSTAGE presented by RTX.

This repository operates under the [FTCLib command-based framework](https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib/v/v2.0.0/), which is based closely on the WPILib framwork used in FRC. It uses [RoadRunner](https://learnroadrunner.com/) for movement and the FTC framework's built-in [EasyOpenCV](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV) for Team Prop detection during the autonomous period.

Below is a list of some additional resources that were useful while creating this repository:

* [OpenCV Skystone Detector](https://github.com/uhs3939/SkyStone/blob/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/opencvSkystoneDetector.java)

*Note: This project will not work as-is, as it lacks the [official FTC framework](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController) as well as the external application dependancies. This is intended for reference use only.*
