# FTC Team 9110 2023 Robot Code

Created for use during Olathe Northwest's in-house competition of the 2023-2024 FIRST Tech Challenge game CENTERSTAGE presented by RTX.

This repository operates under the [FTCLib command-based framework](https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib/v/v2.0.0/). It uses [RoadRunner](https://learnroadrunner.com/) for movement and EasyOpenCV for Team Prop detection during the autonomous period.

Note: This project will not work as-is, as it lacks the [official FTC framework](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController). This is intended for reference use only.
